# Ray Parallel Computing Tutorial

A practical introduction to Ray's distributed computing framework using a coffee shop metaphor. This tutorial demonstrates Ray's core primitives (tasks, actors, and datasets) through concrete, relatable examples.

## What You'll Learn

- Parallel task execution with `@ray.remote`
- Stateful computation using Ray actors
- Distributed data processing with Ray Data
- Performance comparisons: parallel vs sequential execution

## Getting Started

Install Ray and run the notebook:

```bash
pip install ray
jupyter notebook ray-tutorial.ipynb
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Ray 2.0+
- Jupyter Notebook
